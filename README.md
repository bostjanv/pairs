# pairs
Find all pairs of integers in a sorted array that sums to a given value.

Three different algorithms are implemented:

* Find: Finds all pairs (duplicates included). Runs in O(n) time.
* FindUnique: Finds all unique pairs. Runs in O(n) time.
* FindBruteForce: Finds all pairs. Runs in O(n^2) time.

Cd to the 'pairs' directory and run 'go test -bench .' to run some tests and benchmarks. Cd to the 'test' directory and run 'go run main.go' to run a small test application.
